The programs in this directory were written by Uwe Hollerbach

or 
uwe@aix550.phys.rush.edu

and are based on programs written by 
Wolfgang Nonner
wnonner@chroma.med.miami.edu of the Dept of Biophysics
and Physiology at the University of Miami used in the paper
"Ion Permeation and Glutamate
Residues Linked by Poisson-Nernst Planck Theory in L-Type
Calcium Channels" which is supposed to appear in the Sept. 1998
issue of Biophysical Journal.

The code should compile easily in any C compiler.

The code is based on a program for PNP with with spatially varying dielectric
coefficient, diffusion coefficient, and cross sectional area written by
Duan Chen sometime ago,

Another version of this program has been written by Wolfgang Nonner, in
ANSI C, and can be found in the directory,
Eisenberg/Nonner on this server, namely, ftp.rush.edu

We hope you find this code helpful

Ever yours,
